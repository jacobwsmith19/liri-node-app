# liri-node-app

This is a node.js app that uses Axios and several APIs (Spotify, OMDB, Bands in Town) to run the following commands:

**1) "concert-this"

  This command calls the Bands In Town API and returns concert data for the band/artist the user entered.

**2) "spotify-this-song"

  This command calls the Spotify API and returns song data for the song the user entered.

**3) "movie-this"

  This command calls the OMBD API and displays the data for the movie the user entered.

**4) "do-what-it-says"

  This command calls the liri.js file and reads the search term from the random.txt file, and then it will search Spotify for the term. 

Here is a screen shot of each command being run:
